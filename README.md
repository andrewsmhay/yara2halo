###About
YARA is a tool aimed at helping malware researchers to identify and classify malware samples. With YARA you can create descriptions of malware families based on textual or binary patterns contained on samples of those families. Each description consists of a set of strings and a Boolean expression which determines its logic.

The tool, yara2halo, converts your YARA signature files into the Halo policy format. This allows you to automatically create Halo policies for the detection of malware artificats as defined by your collection of YARA signatures.

###Usage
